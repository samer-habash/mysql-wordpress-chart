1) Please note on helpers.tpl file which has the dynamic names/labels/selectorLabels/ etc ... which is defined globally accross the Chart mysql-wordpress
2) The file helm_template_before_installation.yaml describe the output of "helm template ./mysql-wordpress .
Do not use helm template it caused an error until many attempts and I think I can create a new chart then check it this erro has been fixed .
For more info check the unresolved error from issues of helm : https://github.com/devspace-cloud/devspace/issues/447 
3) Reason the mysql did not work because it is waiting for a secret in order to connect to DB , here is this error from the logs with pod status  CreateContainerConfigError :-
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD:  <set to the key 'password' in secret 'mysql-pass'>  Optional: false
